##Practical 11: Exceptions 

## Instructions

This practical focuses on error handling using the Java exception handling mechanism.

###Level 1: Password Database

1. Create a class _User_ that stores the userâ€™s name, a user-name, an email address and a password (String)
2. Create a _PasswordDB_ class that stores a list of _User_ objects.
3. The class _PasswordDB_ must contain a method that creates a new User given a name, a user-name, an email address and a password in the parameters. We assume that the client might be potentially hostile. What actions would you take to make sure that user-names are unique and that a password is at least 8 characters long? Implement the necessary methods/classes, including custom exception classes.

###Level 2: User Interface

1. Create a simple text input interface to update and search the database for a user based on their user name.
2. Display appropriate message dialogs when an error occurs.
3. Test your program with null data entries and incorrect data entries.
